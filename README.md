# Wander Hub API
Wander Hub is a social media platform for travelers to share their trips, explore new places, and connect with other travel lovers. Users can easily create posts with stories and photos, like and comment on others posts, and save their favorites for later. The platform has a simple interface that allows for easy login, post management, and search options, ensuring it works well on all devices. 

The project is developed as a Portfolio Project 5 (Advanced Front End / React) for the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Course. The API supports the backend database, providing models and logic to enable the React frontend to perform CRUD operations.

## Introduction
Wander Hub is a social media platform where travelers can share their trips, discover new places, and connect with other travel lovers. The platform utilizes Django Rest Framework for the back-end and React for the front-end, ensuring a smooth user experience for creating, browsing, and interacting with travel content. This API provides a backend database (models and logic) to allow the frontend React application to perform CRUD operations. Users can easily create posts with stories and photos, interact by liking, commenting, and following others, and save their favorite posts for future reference.

Wander Hub has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to use. It includes features like user login, the ability to create, update, and delete posts, and options to search and filter travel content. The platform is designed to work well on all devices, ensuring a smooth experience for everyone.

## Agile Development Process

### Agile Planning

For this project, I implemented an Agile methodology, organizing the entire process using a GitHub project board. This approach allowed me to manage the development from the initial planning stages to the final deployment. The project was divided into 6 milestones, each representing a key phase of the development process, ensuring that progress was systematic and aligned with the project’s goals.

You can view the entire Project Board, including all user stories and progress updates, here: <a href="https://github.com/users/bhagyashriyogeshpatil/projects/4" target="_blank">Github Project board</a>

#### **User Stories and Management:**

- **Acceptance Criteria:** 
Each user story was created with clear acceptance criteria to ensure that everyone understands what needs to be done. This approach guarantees that every task meets the required standards before it can be marked as complete.

- **MoSCoW Prioritization:** 
To effectively manage priorities, features were categorized using the MoSCoW method: 'Must have,' 'Should have,' and 'Could have.' This prioritization ensured that the essential features for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) were developed first, while secondary features could be added if there was enough time.

- **User Stories Overview:** 
All user stories include:
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Clearly defined requirements for completion.
  - **Labels for Prioritization:** Each feature is labeled as 'Must have,' 'Should have,' or 'Could have' to help prioritize development tasks.

- **Additional Labels:** 
I have also created two additional labels to show which tasks needed backend work and which needed frontend work:    
    - **API-backend** - for tasks related to backend API implementation
    - **React-frontend** - for tasks related to the frontend React app
Each user story was thoroughly checked to ensure it met the requirements before being closed.
